## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use async/await over callbacks

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Optimize performance with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
- Keep components small and focused

### CSS/Styling

- Use CSS modules or styled-components
- Follow BEM naming convention
- Ensure responsive design
- Support dark mode
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography

### File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # Page components
â”œâ”€â”€ services/      # API and business logic

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the Conventional Commits specification:

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

### Examples
```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration

fix(performance): reduce bundle size by 20%

docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting:**
   - Ensure all tests pass: `npm run test`
   - Run linting: `npm run lint`
   - Check types: `npm run type-check`
   - Update documentation if needed

2. **PR Description:**
   - Reference related issues
   - Describe what changes were made
   - Explain why the changes are necessary
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

3. **Review Process:**
   - At least one maintainer review required
   - Address all feedback
   - Keep PR focused and small
   - Squash commits if requested

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies

Example:
```typescript
describe('PerformanceMonitor', () => {
  it('should track web vitals metrics', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const monitor = new PerformanceMonitor();
    
    // Act
    const metrics = await monitor.getMetrics();
    
    // Assert
    expect(metrics).toHaveProperty('FCP');
    expect(metrics.FCP).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Include parameter descriptions and return types
- Provide usage examples for complex APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the performance score based on web vitals
 * @param metrics - Web vitals metrics object
 * @returns Performance score between 0-100
 * @example
 * const score = calculatePerformanceScore({
 *   FCP: 1800,
 *   LCP: 2500,
 *   FID: 100,
 *   CLS: 0.1
 * });
 */
export function calculatePerformanceScore(metrics: WebVitals): number {
  // Implementation
}
```
